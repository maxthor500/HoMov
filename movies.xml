    <PLOT>
          In 1999, Ken Carter accepts the job of basketball coach for his old high school in a poor area of Richmond, CA. 
          As much dismayed by the poor attitudes of his players as well as their dismal play performance, Carter sets about to change both. 
          He imposes a strict regime typified in written contracts that demand respectful behavior, a dress code and good grades for players. 
          Any initial resistance is soon dispelled as the team under Carter's tutelage becomes a undefeated competitor. 
          However, when the overconfident team's behavior begins to stray with too many doing poorly in class, Carter takes immediate action. 
          To the outrage of the team, the school and the community, Carter cancels all team activities and locks the court until the team shows acceptable academic improvement. 
          In the ensuing debate, Carter fights to keep his methods, 
          determined to show the boys that they need good values for their futures and eventually 
          finds he has affected them more profoundly than he ever expected.

    <PLOT>
         Six thugs, who are strangers to each other, are hired by a crime boss, Joe Cabot, to carry out a diamond robbery. 
         Right at the outset, they are given false names with the intention that they won't get too close and will concentrate on the job instead. 
         They are completely sure that the robbery is going to be a success. 
         But, when the police show up right at the time and the site of the robbery, panic spreads amongst the group members, 
         and two of them are killed in the subsequent shootout, along with a few policemen and civilians. 
         When the remaining people assemble at the premeditated rendezvous point (a warehouse), they begin to suspect that one of them is an undercover cop.

    <PLOT>
         Paul "Wrecking" Crewe was a revered football superstar back in his day, but that time has since faded. 
         But when a messy drunk driving incident lands him in jail, Paul finds he was specifically requested by Warden Hazen (James Cromwell), 
         a duplicitous prison official well aware of Paul's athletic skills. Paul has been assigned the task of assembling a team of convicts, 
         to square off in a big football game against the sadistic guards. With the help of fellow convict Caretaker, 
         and an old legend named Nate Scarborough to coach, Crewe is ready for what promises to be a very interesting game. 
         It's only the warden and the guards who have no idea who or what they're up against, with Paul the driving force behind the new team.
